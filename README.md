# Introduction
## summarising objectives
- create semi-automated video processing analysis (reducing number of operators)
- processes normal match streams
- create framework for football data science research (academic or business)
- free and open source

## problems solved to achieve objectives
- detect humans
- detect ball
(
- detect pitch, by machine learning trained by creating image dataset
- map players and ball to pitch
- recognise players
)

## methods
- image processing operations
- image recognition
- object tracking
- sythetic image dataset
- image homographical transformation
- deep/machine learning
- video/play segmentation

## results

(sshot> image recognition, ball and humans)


(sshot> pitch 3d modelling)


(sshot> camera automation, in dataset)


## achievements and limits
### achievements

### limits
spatio-temporal data stream correction
human detection may contain more than 1 human
    consistent ball detection

# Background
problems:

        SKIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




# Work carried out

- video processing
    + machine learning humans and ball recognition
    + object traking
- 3d modelling and dataset generation
    + pitch construction in blender
    + camera positioning
    + data generation scripting
    + homographical transformation



# Testing
## Testing assessment

## Performance assessment

## any other experimental work




# Conclusions
## main achievements
        (relating them to initial objectives)
        (as well as similar worh from others)


## the main limitations of work
- detect ball consistently
- the output will always be an approximation
- video segment detection (also replays)
- calculate ball trajectory
- cannot detect players outside camera frame
- is not real-time, at this moment
- recognise video segments

## possible extensions and future work
- create data format (possibly logical ontology to leverage a logical reasoner)
- calculate off-screen player positioning
- action recognition

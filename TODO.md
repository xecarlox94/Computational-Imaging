pitch recognition
    - apply machine learning model to image
    - homography transformation (get inner section)
    - add image filter to training and program
    - map detected objects to pitch and write to file
    - add vertical movement to blender cameras

testing
    - test randomly positioned camera to blender
    - measure accuracity

manual play segmentation
    - opencv controls

improve ball tracking
    - improve image processing (filter noise, increase ball perception)

data collection
    - detects large human (noise, needs to be removed)
    - color based detection

change texture of blender



find video with video with two different perspective



draw two 2d top down pitch map

draw frustrum view top-down perspectviwe

mapping transform


machine learning (passing examples, highlight regions) use the frustum view



for arc detection!!!
For example you can detect the circular arcs using the circle Hough transform.
equation for line
equation for plane
combine both to calculate camera location
then I can determine view corners
determine position of players on map (feet, head...




image filtering to detect ball better
first step is to identify the picth
bounderies of picth
extract field of view
camera frostroom
where camera is
